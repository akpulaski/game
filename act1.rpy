    anita "Ah… that’s the last box I have to bring up. Ow, my arms…"

    "I had to take a moment to sit down and rub my tired arms."
    anita "And there’s still so much left to unpack. Um, where should I start first? Maybe this box… ?"

    "I peek at the huge cardboard package I set down moments before. "
    "The tape sealing the box shut parts easily under the sharp edge of my scissors. I set the pair aside before flipping open the lid, peering at its contents, and mentally situating them inside my apartment."

    anita "Plates for the cupboards, tea towels for the drawers, and as for the utensils, they should be placed—hm? What’s this?"

    "I reach into the depths of cloth-wrapped ceramics, pulling out a wayward mug that likely fell from its protective wrappings. I heave a mournful sigh as I delicately trace the deep crack along the side."


    anita "My favorite mug! Oh, you poor thing, you’ll leak if I pour anything into you. What a shame. I’ll have to take it out later with the rest of the trash—"

    "I feel my foot catch on something and I stumble. Too late, the mug slips from my grasp and falls to the floor with a—"

    cafe_waiter "I’ve got it, miss! Were you hurt any… where…?"

    "I couldn’t think. My mind went blank. I stared at the screen of my phone with my eyes wide open as terror sank its teeth into my soul. "

    cafe_waiter "Err, miss? A-are you alright? Do you need me to—?"

    anita "No thank you!"

    "I painfully replied as I bolted out of the cafe—heart hammering, throat clogging—as my pounding footsteps drowned out the waiter’s concerned calls."

    "After running what felt like a mile, my thumb shakily punched the contact for Allen <3. It rang once, twice, thrice, and then the call connected."

    allen "Hello?"

    "I opened my mouth."

    "The words won’t come."
    "WHY WON’T THEY COME!?"

    allen "If you aren’t going to say something, I’m hanging up."

    anita "WAIT! I-I—"

    "I choked. It was hard to speak, but I forced my voice to work. Each word set my throat on fire. I took a deep, stuttering breath and tried again. I need to know this."

    "Even if it hurts…"

    anita "O-On Isabelle’s a-account, sh-I tagged you in a ph-photo you took t-t-together y-yesterday."

    allen "So?"

    anita "Sh-I said i-it’s my f-first photo with h-h-my new b-boyfriend."

    anita "Th-that’s wrong, isn’t it? I-I’m the one you’re d-dating, r-right?"

    allen "Anita, we've talked about this so many times. I can’t understand a word you say when you’re acting hysterical."

    "He’s right. If I’m going to despise him for the rest of life, I might as well make what I want to say clear."

    anita "We’ve been together for years! I brought you your favorite coffee every morning, brought you homework and class notes when you were sick, baked you a cake every birthday, and I even named our future cat together!"

    anita "You said you wanted a life with me…"

    anita "Don’t you still want that?"

    allen "…"

    anita "…"

    anita "… Why won’t y-you say a-anything?"

    "I waited in agony for an answer. A beat passed. "

    "He sighed."

    allen "I don’t want to see you anymore. Let’s end it here."

    allen "Now."

    allen "Get your shit and get out of my life."

    anita "Wait, Allen! PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME—!"

    "I hear a click."

    "I hear his dial tone."

    "I tried to call the same number a dozen times, but he kept his silence. Everything after that was a painful blur of screaming and bawling."

    # [Scene change, back to Anita’s apartment. SFX of ticking clock]

    "I stare at the broken mug shattered to shards on the floor for maybe…minutes? Hours? I don’t know anymore. "

    "The world was fuzzy. My hands shake. My shoulders ache. My breaths stagger  as I try to take them in, out, deep—count and hold—before letting it out. "

    anita "Don’t think about him anymore, Anita."

    anita "You’re here to get away from it."

    anita "It may be fresh but You’re fine, it shouldn’t affect you anymore."

    anita "Let’s hope all of the years of manipulating me is a blessing in disguise. Just remember what your therapist said."

    anita "You are beautiful."

    anita "You are worthy."

    anita "You are loved."

    "Even if that last one is a lie."

    anita "I am not some random, desperate stalker girl who couldn’t take a hint where most of the campus turned against you."

    anita "This is a new place where no one knows your name! It’s a new beginning with new neighbors who won’t gossip or post embarrassing photos of you or snicker behind your back."

    anita "I am Anita Carver and I am-"

    anita "..."

    anita "I am pathetic enough to talk to myself…"

    "Who am I kidding? Moving here changes nothing. It’s only a matter of time before I make a mistake and everyone here will—"

    ## [SFX of cat scratching door]

    anita "Huh?"

    ## [SFX footsteps, then door opening]

    anita "Err… A cat?"

    "A midnight black cat gazes back at me through half-lidded eyes. Despite how bored they seemed (if such an expression existed for cats), I couldn’t help but feel like we’re looking into each other’s souls. "


    "It was uncomfortable, to put it lightly."

    anita "What are you doing here, kitty? Are you lost?"

    "The cat yawns. Cats have really sharp teeth."

    anita "Ah? Wait!"

    "It slips into the apartment before I can close the door, padding through the entryway on swift paws. It hops on the dining table and sits, staring at me expectantly. "

    anita "Erm, I-I’m sorry, but I don’t have anything for you to eat. I haven’t shopped for groceries yet."

    "The cat narrows its eyes and yowls. I can’t tell at all if it’s mad or not."


    anita "I-I don’t understand. What is it that you want from me?"


    "Its ear twitches. It stretches its neck, pawing at something there."

    "I come closer and inspect the tag."


    anita "Void? Is that your name?"

    ##Cat Meowing SFX


    void "Meow."


    anita "Um, I’ll consider that as a yes."

    anita "I take it this means you’re lost, then?"

    ##Cat Meowing SFX

    void "Meow."


    "Void meows their affirmation once more. This is almost incredible. Having my own way of communicating with a cat."

    anita "Hm, there’s no phone number on the back of your collar. How am I supposed to find your owner?"


    "Void says nothing and merely stares at me some more. You are absolutely no help right now."

    anita "Well you seem to be in good health, and your coat is only a little messy. It’s not matted or anything.  You couldn’t have been missing for long. And there’s not a lot of mud on your paws either, so you’re not outside too much." 

    anita "Do you live in this building with your owner?"

    ## Cat Meowing SFX	

    void "Meow"

    anita "Maybe…"

    anita "Oh no…"

    anita "One of my neighbors knows who your owner is."

    anita "That means…"

    anita "{b}I have to talk to them!{/b}"

    "I plopped down onto my couch in shere misery at the idea of talking to people right now. Void leaps off the table and pads away. They pause and toss a glance over their shoulder, meowing in order to get my attention."


    anita "D-do you want me to come with you?"
    ## Cat Meowing SFX

    void "Meow."

    anita "Oh, um, but what about my unpacking?"

    ## Irritated Cat SFX

    "Void makes more of a weird grumbling noise, clearly showing  irritation at me."

    "I feel myself caving in and sigh. "

    anita "… Oh, why not? I can put off squaring my things away for an hour or so."

    anita "I just hope this leads somewhere."

    "Void chuffs (is that a good thing?) and turns its back on me, tail swishing lazily as it pitter-patters off."

    anita "Ah, wait for me!"

    "It doesn’t matter. Don’t worry, I’ll find them."

    "As I picked up Void I must have not had a good grip on him as he jumped right out of my arms. Terrified that I already lost the little guy, I scrambled to try and get him."

    "Thankful god he only started rubbing against the door across from me."

    "Maybe he’s telling me something…"

    "A minute goes by. Nothing. Maybe they didn’t hear me?"

    ## Door knocking SFX

    vivian "Hold on!"

    "The harsh command from a woman from behind the door made me and Void jump a little. From the sounds of it, I would guess she’s close to my age."

    "The door was then yanked open to see an alternate styled girl towering over me dressed in mostly black. Her size might be due  to her massive boots though. From the look on her face, my presence wasn’t very welcomed."

    vivian "Can I help you?"

    anita "Y-yes, I was wondering, miss…um…"

    "Oh god I don’t even know her name. Yet I’m here offering her a cat. This is just…nice."

    vivian "Vivian."

    anita "Thank you. Miss Vivan, this cat came scratching at my door. When he jumped out of my arms he came to your door."

    anita "So I was wondering if-"

    vivian "I don’t own a cat. The only pet I have is a parakeet."

    "Did I say something wrong? Why is she coming off so rude?"

    anita "I’m sorry. I’ll…I’ll get going now."

    "Before I was able to make it a few feet down the hall, Vivian’s voice rang out to me. This time in a more gentle tone."

    vivian "Hold on"

    "More afraid of the consequences if I didn’t listen to her, I halted right in front of my door. Taking a deep breath for courage, I turn to face Vivian again."

    vivian "Do you wanna come in for a minute? I’ll call up all the people I know in the complex to see if they’re missing a cat."

    "My first initial thoughts were absolutely not. She scares me as much as it is before our small conversation. "

    "But this was important. This wasn’t about me, it’s about Void. If she can help me, I can…step outside my comfort zone this one time."

    anita "…Okay."

    "The inside of Vivian’s apartment was both exactly what I expected and nothing what I expected at all. It was of course dark with hues of purple due to some kind of lighting. I could see horror memorabilia and CD’s for heavy metal bands."

    "But the overall theme of what I can see of the entire apartment was celestial. If all of the shades and blinds weren’t drawn, I could tell that the walls were painted white and black with hints of gold due the decor that mimicked planets and stars. The lighting I noticed earlier I realized now was a projector showing different galaxies across the celing."

    "It felt like an upgraded version of a teenager’s bedroom but it’s still the most beautifully decorated apartment I’ve been in."

    "I’m even too scared to sit on her couch in fear of Void scratching it up."

    mory "…"

    anita "O-oh. Sorry."

    mory "Hehe. That’s fine. But no, the cat isn’t mine, dear."

    ## There’s a small pause with no dialogue box.

    mory "I assume you’re the new tenant. It's sad that you were told my name before I could introduce myself though hehe."

    anita "Oh… Yes. I’m new here."

    mory "Welcome, miss! Always nice seeing some new faces here and there."

    anita "Thank you. I’m Anita."
    mory "…"

    mory "Are you feeling alright?"

    "No. I’m really dizzy from talking so much today."

    anita "Yes, I’m alright."

    "He laughed. Seems surprisingly nice. I don’t think he’s gonna bite me for now."

    mory "Oh, that’s fine. I’m also a little shy."

    "Yeah… shy…."

    mory "Well, nice to meet you, Anita! Are you trying to find his owner?"

    "He’s onto me."

    anita "Y-yes. He was scratching at my door."

    mory "Well, none of the tenants have any pets aside from the parakeet next door."

    anita "I met Vivian’s parakeet. They’re really pretty."

    mory "Yeah I know she is…"

    mory "Lovie, I mean! Not Vivian!"

    mory "I mean yes, she is pretty but um…"

    mory "…Please don’t tell her I said any of this."

    anita "Hehe, I promise I won’t."

    mory "Oh thank you!"

    mory "But that’s awesome! I love animals as well! I’m trying to get a little pet myself."

    mory "But no, the cat isn’t mine."

    anita "Is he a stray?"

    mory "No, he got a collar."


    "I wanna cry."

    anita "R-right."

    "Why did you interject like that again? You learned about this very long ago.
    He steps a little closer and starts petting {b}Void.{/b}"

    mory "Don’t worry about it, I know how it is. I won’t judge you."

    anita "W-why would you judge him?"

    "…Oh."

    mory "…"

    mory "You should call {b}Mr. Lamlor{/b}. He might know."

    anita "Who?"

    mory "The landlord."

    "How did we not think of calling the landlord?"

    anita "Good idea. Can you give me his number?"

    mory "Sure! I can give you mine too."

    "I pull up my phone and he pulls his. I feel a little embarrassed to open my phone close to people, because my wallpaper is a photo of a certain someone. I know they don’t care or even know who that is, but I still don’t feel very good showing people like that."
    "I need to change it."

    "His phone has a green case, and I think his wallpaper is some kind of cute bug. Eccentric. He opens his contact list and I open mine. A little tingling in my brain rapidly morphs into a personal heatwave as I see a familiar name in it."

    "I already have Mr. Lamlor’s number."

    "…I’ll just pretend to add the number."

    "He asks me to add his number as well. I obey without questioning."

    mory "Give me a call whenever you need anything. I’ll always be there to help!"

    anita "Thank you."

    mory "Also, seeing that you met Vivian, have you met Elly?"

    anita "Elleanor? Oh, yes, I have met her."

    mory "She’s awesome. I haven’t seen her in a bit and I won’t be leaving for today. Lots of work. Can you say I’ll return her watering can tomorrow? She doesn’t have a phone."

    anita "She doesn’t?"

    mory "No, and she’s tight on money."

    anita "Okay. Sure."

    mory "Thank you!"

    anita "Nice meeting you. Sorry for interrupting your work."

    mory "Oh, it’s ok. I love meeting new people!"


    "{b}He isn’t bothered? A first!{/b}"

    anita "G-good to know. I’ll be going now."

    mory "I’ll be here whenever you need anything!"


    "…"

    "He’s staring at me. Or am I staring at him? I don’t know. This is getting awkward. I should go."

    "I turn around and leave immediately."

    mory "Bye!"

    "I can see him waving with a big smile as I turn around."

    "He’s sweet enough"

    "At least I didn’t screw it up this ti–"
    ## Sound: Door closing

    "…"
    "I got startled by the door."

    "I’m so pathetic. I hope that no one saw that. They’ll make fun of me."

    "Then I’ll have to move again."
